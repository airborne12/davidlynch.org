Another new-ish release, this time a PHP webcomic content management system called <a href="http://github.com/kemayo/simplecomic">simplecomic</a>.

Features:
<ul><li>Multiple comics per day</li>
<li>Schedule posting of comics in advance</li>
<li>Masking of comic filenames so scheduled comics can't be easily found</li>
<li>Comic descriptions, alt text, and transcripts</li>
<li>Optional chapter divisions for comics</li>
<li>"Rants" as a lightweight blog, with scheduled posting</li>
<li>Theme system</li>
<li>Static pages</li>
<li>Support for the frontpage showing the first comic from the most recent day with comics, to allow posting of "issues"</li>
</ul>

I wrote it for a friend who wanted to start her own webcomic and wasn't happy with the existing options in the field of webcomic CMSes.

You can see an example <a href="http://acidreflux.ficwad.com/">here</a>. It's a dead webcomic that I happen to be hosting for sentimental reasons. Ignore the Comic Sans... it's also there for sentimental reasons. :P

Get it <a href="http://github.com/kemayo/simplecomic">on github</a>.
