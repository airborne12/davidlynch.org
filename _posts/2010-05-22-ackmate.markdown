In the event that anyone was using my TextMate <a href="http://davidlynch.org/blog/2009/02/textmate-bundle-ack-in-project-improved/">Ack In Project fork</a>, protocool released a successor to Ack In Project called <a href="http://github.com/protocool/AckMate">AckMate</a>.

It's better. Get it instead.
