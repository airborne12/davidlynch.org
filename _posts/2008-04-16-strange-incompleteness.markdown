<a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>'s API documentation is weirdly incomplete.

The <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation">official function reference</a>, for instance, was last updated for WordPress 2.1, and we're now on 2.5.

This is making updating that widget I wrote be more of a hassle than I expected.
