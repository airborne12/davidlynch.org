I've been running <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on my home computer for a week and a half now.  That's right, I've <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/17/of-canaries-and-coal-mines">joined the "A-list blogger circle-jerk"</a>.  For certain values of "A".  Specifically, the value "F".

I've mostly found alternatives for all the programs I used.  The only area where I'm not quite satisfied is a music player; I used <a href="http://foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> on Windows, and I haven't found one to match it yet.  (I've settled on <a href="http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet">Quod Libet</a> at the moment, though its UI is a bit lacking.)

<a href="http://wowwiki.com/Linux/Wine">WoW works</a>, but I seem to be paying a ~10fps tax for running it under Wine.  It's a pain, but it's still playable.

I still have XP on a partition, but I haven't yet run into anything I need to boot into it for.  This is a promising development.

I'm looking forward to Hardy Heron's release.  It'll come with the newer nvidia drivers, which <a href="http://ventnorsblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/magic-169.html">apparently</a> <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=934&num=1">improve performance</a>.  This will be appreciated, as I've been unimpressed by canvas in Linux-Firefox so far.
